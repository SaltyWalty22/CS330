1.	How do I approach designing software?
-	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
-	What design process did you follow for your project work?
-	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

When I am designing software, I approach it conceptually first and try to image and plan what I am wanting to build. By doing this I can apply the new design skills I have acquired from working on this project. When creating 3D scenes, I would first create the individual planes of each object and with the use of a for loop I would potential resize and rotate the planes into the location I desired. After the objects are done, I would get the lighting and textures set up and working as I intend. 

2.	How do I approach developing programs?
-	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
-	How did iteration factor into your development?
-	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

Using an agile software development process helped me while working on my 3D scene. Being able to first imagine the formation of ideas and objects aloud, me to make steps forward before I had to actually develop the code and then test it. Once I got it tested it was a lot easier to tweak it and deploy it as I imagined it. Once I get feedback regarding my project, I can perform additional operations to fix pointed out issues and improve the 3D scene.

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
-	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
-	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computational graphics and visualization give me new knowledge and skills that can be applied in my future by allowing me to understand what all needs to go into something like a simple 3D scene. By understanding what is needed to achieve a goal, I can better assess the scope of the work and dedicate the necessary time and resources to create the building blocks required.  Computer science will also help me reach my professional goals in my job career by being able to properly troubleshoot an issue assuming it appears.
